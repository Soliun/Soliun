<h1 id="hello-world">Hello, World!</h1>
<p>Hello! my name is Josias Silva (jrsolium).</p>
<p>I am a computer science student at the Federal University of Maranh√£o.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/jrsolium/"> YouTube channel </a> where I occasionally practice the art of talking nonsense about technologies I don't know about. Rarely, very rarely, some cool tips come out.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to find me online, <a href="https://linktr.ee/jrsolium_/">click here!</a></p>
